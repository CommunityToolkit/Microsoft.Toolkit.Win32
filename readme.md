## Principles
* Principle **#1**: The toolkit will be kept simple.
* Principle **#2**: As soon as a comparable feature is available in the Windows SDK for Windows 10, it will be marked as deprecated.
* Principle **#3**: All features will be supported for two Windows SDK for Windows 10 release cycles or until another principle supersedes it.
